# College Finder

This application allows users to find college websites based on their search parameters, such as keyword or country. The information for the colleges comes from a combination of two different APIs. Colleges can then be added to a list of favorites, which is saved to local storage. You can view a live version [here.](https://people.rit.edu/jrn2778/330/project3/)

### Note
This application was previously made as an academic project. I moved the code to this new repository for posterity and reference purposes. Find more of my projects at [justinnauta.com](https://justinnauta.com)

## My Role

Sole Developer (The entirety of the application was developed by me)

## Technologies

Vue • TailwindCSS • Adobe XD

## Difficulties

This was my first project using a JavaScript framework (Vue in this case). This provided a set of challenges in terms of re-thinking how I structure my code and design. Vue can make things easier than doing everything “by hand”, but in this case I had to do all the prep work involved with learning Vue first.

## Solution

To be properly prepared to do this project, I learned a lot of Vue from various sources. These included self-learning and experimentation, learning from a friend who uses Vue professionally, and in-class learning at college.

## Notable Features

Two different APIs are used to get the information for the colleges. One provides a list of colleges meeting certain parameters. Those colleges are then fed into the second API, which pulls information from the college websites for display in the app.
